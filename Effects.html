        <h2>Effects on Individuals</h2>
        <p>Poverty has a devastating impact on individuals, affecting both their physical and mental well-being. It can lead to malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Those in poverty often face limited opportunities for education and employment, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.</p>
        <p>Mentally, living in poverty can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. The constant struggle to meet basic needs can create a sense of hopelessness and frustration. Lack of access to social services and mental health support exacerbates these challenges, leading to long-term psychological effects.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="community-effects" class="content">
        <h2>Effects on the Community</h2>
        <p>When poverty is widespread, it can deeply affect the entire community. Communities with high poverty rates tend to have inadequate infrastructure, poor public services, and limited economic opportunities. This can create a cycle of poverty that is difficult to break, as the lack of resources and opportunities prevents individuals from escaping poverty.</p>
        <p>High poverty rates can also lead to increased crime, as individuals may turn to illegal activities out of desperation. Poverty-stricken communities often struggle with underfunded schools, which affects the education and future prospects of young people. Additionally, high poverty levels can strain healthcare systems, as a lack of access to basic healthcare leads to higher rates of preventable diseases and conditions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economic-impact" class="content">
        <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
        <p>The economic consequences of poverty are far-reaching. When large portions of the population are living in poverty, the economy as a whole suffers. Poverty reduces the workforce's productivity, as individuals may not have the skills or health to participate fully in the economy. Additionally, poverty leads to a higher reliance on government support, which strains public resources.</p>
        <p>Businesses also suffer, as the purchasing power of people in poverty is limited. Lower demand for goods and services can slow down economic growth. Furthermore, the lack of access to education and training means that many individuals are not equipped with the skills necessary to take advantage of better-paying jobs, further perpetuating the economic divide.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="social-consequences" class="content">
        <h2>Social Consequences</h2>
        <p>Poverty has serious social consequences, particularly in terms of inequality and social division. People living in poverty are often marginalized and excluded from many aspects of society. This exclusion can manifest in discrimination, stigmatization, and social isolation.</p>
        <p>Social mobility becomes difficult when individuals grow up in poverty, as the opportunities for education, stable housing, and social capital are limited. This can perpetuate intergenerational poverty, where children born into poverty are more likely to experience poverty throughout their lives. As a result, the divide between the wealthy and the poor widens, leading to a more divided society.</p>
