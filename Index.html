            <h2>How Poverty Affects Me</h2>
            <p>Poverty can have a profound impact on my life, affecting my physical and mental well-being. Limited access to resources like education, healthcare, and nutritious food can hinder my potential. I may also face social stigma or struggle with unstable housing and employment. These challenges can create feelings of hopelessness and frustration, making it harder to thrive.</p>

            <h2>How Poverty Affects the Community</h2>
            <p>Poverty affects entire communities, creating cycles of inequality. High levels of poverty can lead to increased crime, reduced access to quality education, and strained healthcare systems. It can also result in social fragmentation, as individuals may feel disconnected or marginalized. Communities with widespread poverty face greater challenges in terms of economic development, infrastructure, and overall well-being.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Causes of Poverty</h2>
            <p>Poverty is caused by a range of factors, both systemic and individual. Some common causes include lack of access to quality education, unemployment, inadequate healthcare, and systemic inequality. Other factors, such as natural disasters, economic recessions, and conflicts, can also contribute to the rise of poverty in specific regions. Addressing these root causes is key to breaking the cycle of poverty.</p>

            <h2>What I Can Change in My Community</h2>
            <p>In my community, I can take several steps to help alleviate the effects of poverty. Volunteering my time at local shelters, food banks, or educational programs can make a direct impact. Additionally, advocating for policies that support affordable housing, healthcare, and education can contribute to long-term change. I can also raise awareness about the importance of community support, encouraging others to get involved and make a difference.</p>
