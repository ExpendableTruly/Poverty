        <h2>Effects on Individuals</h2>
        <p>Poverty has a devastating impact on individuals, affecting both their physical and mental well-being. It can lead to malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Those in poverty often face limited opportunities for education and employment, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.</p>
        <p>Mentally, living in poverty can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. The constant struggle to meet basic needs can create a sense of hopelessness and frustration. Lack of access to social services and mental health support exacerbates these challenges, leading to long-term psychological effects.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="community-effects" class="content">
        <h2>Effects on the Community</h2>
        <p>When poverty is widespread, it can deeply affect the entire community. Communities with high poverty rates tend to have inadequate infrastructure, poor public services, and limited economic opportunities. This can create a cycle of poverty that is difficult to break, as the lack of resources and opportunities prevents individuals from escaping poverty.</p>
        <p>High poverty rates can also lead to increased crime, as individuals may turn to illegal activities out of desperation. Poverty-stricken communities often struggle with underfunded schools, which affects the education and future prospects of young people. Additionally, high poverty levels can strain healthcare systems, as a lack of access to basic healthcare leads to higher rates of preventable diseases and conditions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="economic-impact" class="content">
        <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
        <p>The economic consequences of poverty are far-reaching. When large portions of the population are living in poverty, the economy as a whole suffers. Poverty reduces the workforce's productivity, as individuals may not have the skills or health to participate fully in the economy. Additionally, poverty leads to a higher reliance on government support, which strains public resources.</p>
        <p>Businesses also suffer, as the purchasing power of people in poverty is limited. Lower demand for goods and services can slow down economic growth. Furthermore, the lack of access to education and training means that many individuals are not equipped with the skills necessary to take advantage of better-paying jobs, further perpetuating the economic divide.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="social-consequences" class="content">
        <h2>Social Consequences</h2>
        <p>Poverty has serious social consequences, particularly in terms of inequality and social division. People living in poverty are often marginalized and excluded from many aspects of society. This exclusion can manifest in discrimination, stigmatization, and social isolation.</p>
        <p>Social mobility becomes difficult when individuals grow up in poverty, as the opportunities for education, stable housing, and social capital are limited. This can perpetuate intergenerational poverty, where children born into poverty are more likely to experience poverty throughout their lives. As a result, the divide between the wealthy and the poor widens, leading to a more divided society.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Causes of Poverty Section -->
    <section id="causes" class="content">
        <h2>Causes of Poverty</h2>
        <p>Poverty is a complex issue that is influenced by a variety of factors. These causes often interconnect, making it challenging to address poverty through a single solution. Some of the key causes include:</p>
        
        <div>
            <h3>1. Lack of Education</h3>
            <p>Education is one of the most important tools for breaking the cycle of poverty. Without access to quality education, individuals are less likely to secure well-paying jobs and are often limited to low-wage or informal employment. Education empowers people, providing them with the knowledge and skills needed for economic mobility.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>2. Unemployment and Underemployment</h3>
            <p>Unemployment and underemployment are major contributors to poverty. Many individuals are unable to find stable jobs that pay a livable wage. Additionally, some workers may be employed in jobs that don't offer adequate benefits or job security, preventing them from escaping poverty. Economic downturns, lack of industry diversification, and automation further exacerbate this issue.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>3. Health Issues</h3>
            <p>Health problems can trap individuals and families in poverty. Chronic illnesses, disabilities, or mental health issues may limit a person’s ability to work and earn an income. Medical expenses and the inability to access affordable healthcare add a financial burden, further entrenching individuals in poverty.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>4. Inequality and Discrimination</h3>
            <p>Discrimination based on race, gender, ethnicity, or disability can restrict access to education, employment, and other opportunities. Inequality often means that certain groups are denied the resources and opportunities needed to succeed, perpetuating the cycle of poverty across generations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>5. Economic Instability</h3>
            <p>Economic instability, whether on a national or global scale, can lead to high unemployment, inflation, and a rise in the cost of living. In times of economic crisis, many individuals lose their jobs, housing, and savings, pushing them into poverty. For example, recessions and natural disasters can disrupt local economies and worsen poverty conditions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>6. Poor Access to Resources</h3>
            <p>Lack of access to essential resources such as clean water, affordable housing, and reliable transportation can also keep people in poverty. Living in impoverished conditions without these basic necessities can severely limit an individual’s ability to succeed or even survive. Many rural or low-income urban areas face significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare, education, and social services.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>7. Political Instability and Corruption</h3>
            <p>In countries or regions with political instability or high levels of corruption, poverty is often widespread. Corruption can divert resources that are meant for social programs, while political instability can disrupt employment opportunities, access to healthcare, and even safety. These factors prevent economic development and contribute to a cycle of poverty.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>8. Globalization</h3>
            <p>While globalization has contributed to economic growth in many parts of the world, it has also led to increased inequality. Many low-income countries or regions have been left behind in the global economy. Local businesses may be unable to compete with multinational corporations, which leads to job losses and growing poverty in certain sectors of society.</p>
